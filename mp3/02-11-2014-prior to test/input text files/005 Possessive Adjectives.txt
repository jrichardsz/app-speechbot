Possessive Adjectives

What are possessive adjectives?

    Possessive adjectives - my, your, his, her, its, our, your, their - 
	modify the noun following it in order to show possession.

    Examples:

        I'll get my bag.
        Is this your luggage?

    Possessive adjectives are often confused with possessive pronouns.

    Examples:

        Your bike is blue. (your is an adjective which modifies bike)
        Mine is yellow. (mine is a pronoun which functions as the subject of the verb is)

    2. its, their are possessive adjectives.

        Its color is beautiful.
        Their car is in their garage.

        My house is big. It's got five bedrooms = It has got five bedrooms.
        Nancy and Alan are from New York. They're my friends = They are my friends.
