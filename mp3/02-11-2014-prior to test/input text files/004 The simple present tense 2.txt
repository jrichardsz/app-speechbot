        its form
        and its use.

    Before you continue the lesson read the following passage 
	and try to see how the verbs are formed and used.

The forms of the simple present

    The affirmative form of the simple present:
	
    I, you, we, they 	play.
    He, she, it 	plays.

    Remember the verbs in the third person singular (he,she and it) always take an "s". 
	For example, "he plays, she sings,it works..."

    Examples:

        Nancy and James speak good German.
        Nancy works in a restaurant downtown.
        The children play in the garden every weekend.

    The interrogative form of the simple present:

	Do 	I, you, we, they 	play?
	Does 	he, she, it

Examples:

The negative form of the simple present: 

I, you, we,they 	do not 	play.
I, you, we,they 	don't
He, she, it 	does not
He, she, it 	doesn't

    Examples:

    The simple present is used:

        to give your opinion - I like ice cream. I don't like spicy food.

The spelling of the third person singular form of the simple present:

    All the verbs take an "s" in the simple present when conjugated 
	in the third person singular (he, she, it) form:
    Examples:

        I visit my parents every summer holiday. 
		But my wife visits her parents every weekend.

    So the rule is:
    He / she / it + Verb + S

    There are however some special cases. Here are the spelling rules:

    Exception:

        The verb to have changes its forms as follows:

        I have = he / she / it has

    1.In the interrogative forms, we use "do" or "does".

        "Do you like the house?"
        "Does she go to school?"

        "Does he speak German?"
        "Do they play soccer?"
        She doesn't like ice cream.

    3. don't is the short form of "do not". You can say either:
